## ðŸ’¡ Abstract

#### Understanding semantic intricacies and high-level concepts is essential in image sketch generation, and this challenge becomes even more formidable when applied to the domain of videos. To address this, we propose a novel optimization-based framework for sketching videos represented by the frame-wise BÃ©zier Curves. In detail, we first propose a cross-frame stroke initialization approach to warm up the location and the width of each curve. Then, we optimize the locations of these curves by utilizing a semantic loss based on CLIP features and a newly designed consistency loss using the self-decomposed 2D atlas network. Built upon these design elements, the resulting sketch video showcases impressive visual abstraction and temporal coherence. Furthermore, by transforming a video into SVG lines through the sketching process, our method unlocks applications in sketch-based video editing and video doodling, enabled through video composition, as exemplified in the teaser.

### Getting Start
if optimize the example, only (1)(5)

##### (1) build up the environment: 

the total training need projects of layer **neural layer atlas** and **diffvg**

```
<!-- install all and train from begining -->
sh scripts/install.sh
<!-- install diffvg(optimize the example) -->
sh scripts/install_diffvg.sh
```

##### (2) download Dataset or take your own data(less than 70 frames,and extract masks), put on the folder <data>:

```
wget https://data.vision.ee.ethz.ch/csergi/share/davis/DAVIS-2017-Unsupervised-trainval-Full-Resolution.zip
 
unzip DAVIS-2017-Unsupervised-trainval-Full-Resolution.zip
```

or using the examples data and extract the masks skip this step.

##### (3) process/crop the data:

```
sh scripts/process_dataset.sh
```

##### (4) build up atlas:
```
sh scripts/operate_atlas.sh <video_name>
```

##### (5)compute clipavideo:
```
sh scripts/operate_clipavideo.sh <video_name>
```
